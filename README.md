# 24_7_AI_chatbots
This project explores the implementation of LangChain to develop an AI-powered chatbot capable of automating customer interactions for businesses. Using NewGen Migration Limited as a case study, this chatbot was designed to provide real-time, accurate responses to user inquiries about visa applications and immigration services.

The chatbot employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), LangChain, and Metaâ€™s Llama-3-8B model to dynamically fetch and generate answers from website content. By replacing static knowledge bases with intelligent, context-aware AI systems, businesses can enhance customer engagement, increase lead conversion rates, and improve operational efficiency.
